I've created a comprehensive task management app with the following features:\n\n## **Key Features Implemented:**\n\n### **1. Home Screen (`app/index.tsx`)**\n- Clean, modern interface with role selection\n- Two main paths: Organizer and Participant\n- Intuitive icons and clear call-to-actions\n\n### **2. Organizer Screen (`app/organizer.tsx`)**\n- Create task lists with title, description, and organizer email\n- Add multiple unique tasks with titles and descriptions\n- View task statistics (Available, Assigned, Total)\n- Remove tasks that haven't been assigned yet\n- Generate shareable links for participants\n- Real-time updates as tasks are drawn\n\n### **3. Participant Screen (`app/participant.tsx`)**\n- Enter email address to draw a task\n- Random task selection from available tasks\n- Beautiful result display when a task is drawn\n- Prevents duplicate assignments (each task only assigned once)\n- Option to draw another task or return home\n\n### **4. Supporting Components & Hooks:**\n- **`TaskCard`**: Displays individual tasks with status badges\n- **`useTasks`**: Custom hook managing all task-related state and operations\n- **`Task` & `TaskList` types**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety\n- **Updated styling**: Light theme with calming blue and green colors\n\n### **5. Key Features:**\n- \u2705 **Unique task assignment**: Each task can only be drawn once\n- \u2705 **Email-based participant identification**: Tracks who drew which task\n- \u2705 **Real-time statistics**: Shows available vs assigned tasks\n- \u2705 **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and web\n- \u2705 **Clean, minimalistic UI**: Plenty of whitespace and modern design\n- \u2705 **Smooth navigation**: File-based routing with Expo Router\n\n### **6. Technical Highlights:**\n- Uses local state management (no backend required initially)\n- TypeScript for type safety\n- React Native best practices\n- Smooth animations and transitions\n- Proper error handling with alerts\n- Console logging for debugging\n\nThe app is ready to use! Organizers can create task lists, add tasks, and share links with participants. Participants can then draw random tasks, with each task being assigned only once. The interface is clean, user-friendly, and follows modern mobile app design principles.\n\nWould you like me to add any additional features, such as task categories, due dates, or enhanced sharing options?"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-18T14:20:01Z"}]
